This program will ask the user to enter a URL to parse, and if valid set the crawler free to gather links and crawl the domain. 

Warning: if using this code DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT set a crawler free to roam about the web, is a very annoying practise and you will overload servers unnecesarily. This is only to demonstrate my work and help people who wants to learn how you can do something like this. Is an assignment that I did for Uni an therefore is thought to Crawl the environment set by the lecturers.

I take no responsability whatsoever on the miss-usage of this code by anyone.
